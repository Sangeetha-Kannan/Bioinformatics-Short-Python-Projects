## Overview

This project provides tools for various bioinformatics tasks using Biopython. The tools include:

1. **Parsing FASTA Files**: Extract sequence IDs and lengths.
2. **Finding Motifs in DNA Sequences**: Identify specific motifs within DNA sequences.
3. **Generating Reverse Complements**: Generate the reverse complement of DNA sequences.
4. **Translating DNA to Protein**: Translate DNA sequences to their corresponding protein sequences.
5. **Downloading and Parsing GenBank Files**: Download GenBank files and extract protein data.
